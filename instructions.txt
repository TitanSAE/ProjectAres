Harvest minerals from the Mars surface and soil by scouting out extraction sites (marked by a rock symbol on the map).
Find packages from Earth by scouting, too. They are delivered periodically.
You can carry multiple extraction samples at a time, but only 1 Earth package.
You can also use the remote helicopter to scout for either.

To win, build all the buildings at home base.
To build, have at least 1 Mars extraction sample and an Earth package, then run over one of the building pads at home base. Then the astronauts that are coming can successfully colonize Mars!

If you are too damaged, or 6 Mars years pass, you will have lost. The astronauts will not be able to colonize Mars.
To repair yourself, visit the repair centre at home base.
